Trail of Automation

Check from video 1 and update


Video part 8
Classes changes in Video 8

Driver.java // refactoring changes in 
if (Objects.isNull(DriverManager.getDriver()))
DriverManager.setDriver(new ChromeDriver()); // refactoring code

BaseTest
	change methods to protected 

Check the class wise code that has
final class 
private constructor
public testcases methods
naming conventions

Properties file -- why we need that
when/if manual tester wants to change the values of e.g URL, browser, etc. they dont need to go to class level
hence create folder under resources ==>> config
Create file as config.properties

for naming labels use lowercase for easy use e.g url, browser, implicitwait

Create a package Utils
Class as ReadPropertyFile
null error found as "Key" as string passed >> changed to key
to avoid nullpointer error let add code for custom exception if case
-------------------------------

Video part 9
javatraingsession >> StaticBlocks >> Runner.java 
this example of static block which is also called eager initialization

In ReadPropertyFile >> we have lazy initialization
so add static block in that class modify getValue method

whenever we pass String value(input parameter) always check for Nullpointer
so add check for the string input parameter >> thumb rule 

changes in getvalue method >> direct passing

now Hashtable concept are there so refer and complete Naveens lessons then continue from Minibytes part 9 >> https://youtu.be/LcX1BeBJJso?t=689
